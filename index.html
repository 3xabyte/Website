                        My name is Matt McBurnie, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at
                        Wilfrid Laurier University.

                        I began my coding journey in early 2016 when I was in a Grade 10
                        Communications Technology class. I was with a small group of friends and we
                        accidentally found the Chrome DevTools. We had a lot of fun messing around
                        with the HTML elements on websites such as Google. Since that was a local
                        change, refreshing would have brought everything back to normal
                        (thankfully.) Later in the course, students had to make a basic website in
                        Adobe Dreamweaver. I thought doing all of this was cool, and decided to take
                        an intro to computer science course where students learned Python. From
                        there I decided to go for a degree in computer science since this was fun!
